What to Include in a CV ?


A CV should at least include the following:

Personal information


Work experience


Skills


Education


Personal profile and interests


References


Personal Information


Personal information should include name, address, telephone, and email. I will suggest you put this information at the top of your CV and make it look like a letterhead.


Work Experience


List what you have done - most recent work experience first. Include a short job description and your responsibilities. Make sure your work experience is on the first page of your CV. This outlines your skills and selling points.


Skills


Skills are best described with a list. List your skills - most important and relevant first.


Education


Education is best described with a list. List what you have studied - most recent education first.


Don't forget subject options, special project, courses, or diplomas.


References


List only a few names - like a teacher from your place of study, and a superior from a work situation - and make sure they can easily be reached and are willing to give you a good reference.


Personal Profile


Personal profile should include additional information about your age, status, interests and other relevant information that can produce a positive picture of your character. Put this in the last paragraph of your CV.
